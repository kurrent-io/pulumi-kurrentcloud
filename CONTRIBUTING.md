# Contributing to Pulumi

Do you want to hack on Pulumi?  Awesome!  We are so happy to have you.

Please refer to the [main Pulumi repo](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/)'s [CONTRIBUTING.md file](
https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to do so.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Python 3.7 or later
- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- [`pulumictl`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumictl)

This repository includes a config to setup a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/), which will
setup an environment with all necessary requirements installed.

## Committing Generated Code

Code generated for Pulumi SDKs should be checked in as part of the pull request containing a
particular change. To generate code after making changes, run `make build` from the root of this
repository.

## Building the Provider

The provider is generated from the Kurrent Cloud Terraform provider. To build the Pulumi provider
and generate SDKs:

1. Ensure you're in the development container
2. Run the following command to build all SDKs:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

This will:

- Build the provider binary
- Generate SDKs for Node.js, Python, Go, and .NET

## Manual Testing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This will create and destroy **real** Kurrent Cloud resources

To test your changes before committing them:

1. Build the provider using the [steps above](#building-the-provider)
2. Install the provider locally:

    ```bash
    pulumi plugin install resource kurrentcloud --file bin/pulumi-resource-kurrentcloud
    ```

3. Temporarily set the version in the TypeScript SDKs `package.json`

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/${VERSION}/0.0.1-dev/' sdk/nodejs/package.json
    ```

4. Login to Pulumi locally to prevent being prompted to login to the hosted service

    ```bash
    pulumi login --local
    ```

5. Change directory to the test project

    ```bash
    cd test
    ```

6. Install the local version of the TypeScript SDK

    ```bash
    yarn add @kurrent/pulumi-kurrentcloud@file:../sdk/nodejs
    ```

7. Create a new stack

    ```bash
    PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=very-secure-passphrase pulumi stack init -s dev
    ```

8. Set config values

    ```bash
    pulumi config set kurrentcloud:organizationId <ORG_ID>
    pulumi config set kurrentcloud:token <ACCESS_TOKEN> --secret
    ```

9. Create the stack

    ```bash
    pulumi up -y
    ```

10. Once you're done, clean up resources and revert the change to `package.json`

    ```bash
    PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=very-secure-passphrase pulumi destroy -y &&
    pulumi stack rm dev -y &&
    cd .. && sed -i 's/0.0.1-dev/${VERSION}/' sdk/nodejs/package.json
    ```

## Publishing a New Release

Once all changes have been merged to the `main` branch and you're ready to cut a new release, all
that needs to be done is to create a new tag using semver format, e.g. v1.0.0.

Once the tag has been pushed to the Github repo, an action will be triggered. This will create new a
new Github release with the binary artifacts, as well as publish the SDKs to NPM, NuGet, and PyPI.
The release requires the `NPM_TOKEN`, `PULUMI_NUGET_KEY`, and `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repository secrets.

The provider docs in the Pulumi Package Registry will be updated automatically sometime later.
