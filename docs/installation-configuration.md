## Installation

The Kurrent Cloud provider is available as a package in all Pulumi languages:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: [`@kurrent/pulumi-kurrentcloud`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kurrent/pulumi-kurrentcloud)
- Python: [`pulumi_kurrentcloud`](https://pypi.org/project/pulumi-kurrentcloud/)
- Go: [`github.com/kurrent-io/pulumi-kurrentcloud/sdk/go/kurrentcloud`](https://github.com/kurrent-io/pulumi-kurrentcloud)
- .NET: [`Pulumi.KurrentCloud`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pulumi.KurrentCloud)

## Setup

### Configure the provider

The Pulumi provider needs credentials to authenticate requests from your computer to Kurrent Cloud. Your credentials are never sent
to pulumi.com. The provider needs to be configured with Kurrent Cloud credentials before it can be used to create resources.

First, you need an access token for your user, which you can obtain from the Kurrent Cloud console.

Then, go to the list of organizations you have access to in the Kurrent Cloud console, choose the organization that you will be provisioning resources for, and find the organization id in the settings.

- `<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`: your access token
- `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>`: the Kurrent Cloud organization id

Once the credentials are obtained, there are two ways to communicate your authorization tokens to Pulumi:

1. Set the environment variables `ESC_TOKEN` and `ESC_ORG_ID`:

    ```bash
    $ export ESC_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
    $ export ESC_ORG_ID=<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>
    ```

2. Set them using configuration, if you prefer that they be stored alongside your Pulumi stack for easy multi-user access:

    ```bash
    pulumi config set kurrentcloud:token <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> --secret
    pulumi config set kurrentcloud:organizationId <YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID> --secret
    ```
